# Important functions : findall, search, split, match, sub, finditer|
# ------------------------------------------------------------------|
# search = If matched pattern found anywhere in string then it returns match object else None, scans through whole string.
#          - Find something anywhere in the string and return a match object.
# match = Find something at the beginning of the string and return a match object else None, Does only beginning of string.
#
# search & match => match is much faster than search
# a = "123abc"
# t = re.match("[a-z]+",a)
# t = re.search("[a-z]+",a)
#
# findall = If matched pattern found in string then it returns all the matches string in a LIST.
#           - If doesnt match then returns Empty LIST.
# finditer = If matched pattern found in string then it returns position i.e. starting index and ending index of matched pattern,
#             here ending index always shows 1 extra position.
# sub = This is nothing but Substitute/Replace.
#         - If matched pattern found in string then it replaces with the given string and returns it.
#         - If the pattern is no found, then returns the original string.
#         - You can pass COUNT as a fourth parameter, default it is 0 means replace all occurrences.
# subn = This is same as sub() except 1 thing which is below,
#         - This returns a tuple of 2 items containing the new string and the number of substitutions made.
# split = This method splits the string where there is a match and returns a LIST of strings where the splits have occurred.
#         - If the pattern is no found, re.split() returns a LIST containing an empty string.
#         - You can pass maxsplit argument to the re.split() method. It's the maximum number of splits that will occur.
