pipeline Generators :
    Generators can be used to pipeline a series of operations.

Suppose we have a log file from a famous fast food chain.
The log file has a column (4th column) that keeps track of the number of pizza sold every hour and
we want to sum it to find the total pizzas sold in 5 years.
Assume everything is in string and numbers that are not available are marked as 'N/A'.
A generator implementation of this could be as follows.

Source code :
with open('sells.log') as file:
    pizza_col = (line[3] for line in file)
    per_hour = (int(x) for x in pizza_col if x != 'N/A')
    print("Total pizzas sold = ",sum(per_hour))
