# Closure |
----------|
- Execution of Nested Function outside its scope, this technique is called as Closure.
- A function defined inside another function is called a Nested Function.
- Nested functions can access variables of the enclosing scope and these non-local variables are read only by default.
- To modify value of these non-local variables we have to declare those variables with "nonlocal" keyword inside Nested Function.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Closure is a function(Nested) object that remembers values of enclosing scopes even if they are not present in memory.
•	Important things of Closure,
    o	Nested Function should exists
    o	Nested function must refer values in Enclosing Scope
    o	Enclosing function(Higher Order) must return nested function reference(Not call to function)
    o	We can’t call nested function outside of its scope but with the help of Closure we can use/call nested function.

•	Advantages
    o	Can avoid global values
    o	Provides kind of data hiding
    o	Helps in Decorator
