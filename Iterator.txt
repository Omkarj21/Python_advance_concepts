# Iterator |
-----------|
- Iterator is an object
- They are elegantly implemented within for loops, comprehensions, generators..
- Python iterator object must implement two special methods, __iter__()and __next__(), collectively called the iterator protocols.
- An object is called iterable if we can get an iterator(i.e. value) from it. Most of built-in containers in Python like: list, tuple, string etc. are iterables.
- One value at a time, reading items one by one is called iteration.
